# CNN-Autoencoder-for-image-denoising
This notebook shows the preocess of designing CNN -autoencoder and using itfor image denoising .
Libraries used --
1) Numpy
2) Tensorflow
Observations --
i) Training the same model for both clear and noisy images helps the autoencoder to learn better encoding for the image .
ii) It makes it more robust and perform better .
